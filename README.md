RickRollBot

A basic reddit PRAW python bot which identifies and replies to any rickroll links found on r/all (basically the whole of reddit)

Feel free to add any features to this basic framework, like deleting its own comment if it gets downvoted over time, or even identifying fake rickroll links and whatnot. Basic framework for a comment bot too. 

If y'all do anything cool with it send it to me I'd love to see it.
